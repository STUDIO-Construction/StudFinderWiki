# 4" Studs - 16" OC w/ Box Header

This recipe uses a combination of a number of strategies that include: Create Jambs and Headers, Parallel Members, Truss Header, Similarity to Load Direction, and Apply Standard Naming.  The recipe puts 400T250 on all horizontal members and 400S200 on all vertical members.  For openings created by the Create Jambs and Headers strategy it generates a box header using 400S200 members for both the strong-axis studs and 400T250 for the tracks. It includes vertical studs that are 16" on center.
