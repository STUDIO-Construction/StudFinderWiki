# Recipes

Recipes are made up of a series of strategies that take any region and modify it.  In StudFinder there are a number of built-in recipe assets that are described below.  The real power of StudFinder recipes are unlocked when users begin to create their own unique recipes. Currently the ability to create recipes is limited to our Grasshopper integration.  If you need additional recipes or strategies created please reach out to us on the forum or at help@studio-construction.com.
