# Parallel Member Strategy

The parallel member strategy is a technique used to fill a region with parallel members of a particular direction at a particular spacing. Properties that need to be assigned with this fill strategy are, origin (optional), direction, and a spacing.  If no origin is provided by default StudFinder will look for the furthest left point of the region and use that.
