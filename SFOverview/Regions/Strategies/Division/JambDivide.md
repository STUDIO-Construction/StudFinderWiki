# Jamb Divide

The jamb divide strategy is used to subdivide a region into sub-regions based on edges of a region that are similar to a jamb condition.  This strategy requires you to provide a recipe that the sub-regions created by this strategy would inherit.Additionally, you can provide an optional threshold value for determining jambs based on verticallity, and an optional header strategy which would create a header over any openings in the region.
