# Jamb Divide

The jamb divide strategy is used to subdivide a region into sub-regions based on edges that resemble a jamb condition. This strategy requires you to provide a recipe that the sub-regions created by this strategy will inherit. Additionally, you can specify an optional threshold value to determine jambs based on their verticality, and an optional header strategy to create a header over any openings in the region.

For most wall regions, it is recommended to provide a simple recipe of just a parallel member strategy for the regions created by this strategy to inherit.
