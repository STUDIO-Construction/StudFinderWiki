# Standard Naming
The standard naming convention strategy takes an existing Assembly and renames the members within that assembly numerically.  Horizontal members are named first, starting from the bottom left, with vertical members coming after horizontals, named left to right.  This naming convention can speed up production of panels by ordering the members in a predictable manner for the production team.
