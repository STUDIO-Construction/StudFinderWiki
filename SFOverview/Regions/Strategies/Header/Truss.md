# Truss Header
The truss header strategy is a header strategy for use over openings in a region.  To use this strategy you will need to provide inputs to parameters such as: height, max bay width, max bay gap, include verticals?, bay pattern, and optionally any specific user points that are needed in the truss pattern.  StudFinder will use those parameters to lay out a fabricatable truss that over header conditions.
