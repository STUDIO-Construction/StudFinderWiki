# Box Header

The box header strategy is a header strategy for use over openings in a region.  This strategy creates a box header based on the MemberType you provide to be used in the strong direction of the header.  If you need a deeper header than the machine you are using for the wall allows, you can provide a generic stud member type with no associated machine and the software will provide enough space for a member of that height to be manually placed there.
