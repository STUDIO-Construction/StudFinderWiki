# GetMemberBrep

This command will extract the selected member(s) brep representation into Rhino.  The members will also be left along and continue to be in the active project.

This can be useful if you want to send a model of your structures to someone who potentially doesn't have StudFinder or if you need to import your structure into a software that does not have a current StudFinder integration such as Navisworks or SketchUp.
