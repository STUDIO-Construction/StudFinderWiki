# MakeFrameDrawing

Converts a frame into a 2D drawing with labels and annotations for documentation and creates a layout for each frame.  To use you will have to select atleast one stud from each frame that you want to draw.  The drawing will currently not live-update as the frame is updated.

**NOTE**: This command is under development. We look forward to rapidly improving it to add additional automation such as material lists, dimensions, notes etc.  If you would like to provide input on this please reach out to us on the (community forum)[https://studio.discourse.group/].

### Input
One or more StudFinder member from each assembly to be drawn.
