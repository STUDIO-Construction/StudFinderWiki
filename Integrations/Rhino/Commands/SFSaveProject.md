# SFSaveProject

This command outputs a *.stud* file of the project in its current state.  

This .stud file is useful for archiving during fabrication, saving a copy to send to someone else, or to bring into another StudFinder integration.  A .stud file is universal and able to be saved and opened on all StudFinder platforms including Rhino/Grasshopper, Revit, and the Web App.
