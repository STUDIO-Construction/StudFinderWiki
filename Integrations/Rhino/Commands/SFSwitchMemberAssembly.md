# SFSwitchMemberAssembly

Allows you to change what assembly a member is a part of by selecting the member(s) you want to change the assembly of, followed by selecting the member that is a part of an assembly you want it to join. This does not impact the solution of that particular structure, just how members are organized in it.

### Input
One or more StudFinder member to modify the assembly of.

An existing member of the assembly you want to switch to.
